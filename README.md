# Sales-Performance-Dashboard
The Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of retail business performance across various regions, product categories, and customer segments.
It enables users to visualize sales trends, profitability, discount patterns, and return analysis, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

This project uses the dataset “Sales Data Set for Dashboard.xlsx”, which contains detailed records of sales transactions, returns, and management mappings.
